This usually affects any player on the device. Try to Unpair, then Pair BT device again<br/><br/>- HTC Sense 4.0+Beats ROMs produces skips. Try to disable beats for Stellio<br/><br/>- additional 3rd party audio effects. Try to temporarily disable additional audio effects and check if it helps<br/><br/>- some cpu hungry apps (free app like OSMonitor can show total and per process cpu consumption and find offending app/service)<br/><br/>- some broken formats (if skipping happens for the same songs, always, and doesn't happen for others)<br/><br/>You can increase audio buffer in order to prevent stuttering via Settings => Audio => Audio buffer size"
